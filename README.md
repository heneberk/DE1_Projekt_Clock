# Popis programu

This project presents a digital clock design in VHDL. The program includes the functions of a classic digital clock, stopwatch and alarm. 
  The digital clock works on the clock principle (1Hz), which counts pulses on the rising edge. The time setting itself is implemented using the yellow buttons on the board. The setting is done using the buttons. To set the time, you can select a given 7-segment display and set the exact time.
  The stopwatch function is similar to the basic clock function. It works on the clock principle with a frequency of 1 Hz for counting numbers. The stopwatch is controlled by only one button (the middle yellow one). After the first press of the button, the stopwatch starts. After the second press, the counting stops. The stopwatch can be reset using switch 2.
  The last function of the project is the alarm. The alarm provides the ability to set the time, when reached, a signal is generated. This is connected to the LED diode to control the alarm function.
